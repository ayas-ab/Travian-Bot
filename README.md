# Travian-Bot

An old project from 2014, probably wont work now since the game has changed from back then.

It is a bot for a browser game called http://www.travian.com made with java while fooling around with HtmlUnit http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/

The bot automates players upgrading buildings, training troops, and raiding.

The gui was made with netbeans drag and drop

This is a video of how it looked like and worked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqQEtc2T308 (Skip to 0:46) on a travian private server.

Really old youtube account, have not used it since 2014, and i do not use it anymore.
